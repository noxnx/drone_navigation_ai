I am building out an AI drone navigation system with no prior knowledge in AI or robotics. 

The first goal is to make a drone fly in an indoor space without crashing into surrounding objects. 
i will use OpenCV and use Tensorflow. 
hardware is the DJI Tello.

the second will be a more advanced drone AI. it will be able to fly in an outdoor space using GPS.
